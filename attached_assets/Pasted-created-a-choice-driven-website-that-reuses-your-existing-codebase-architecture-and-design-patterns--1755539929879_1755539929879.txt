created a choice-driven website that reuses your existing codebase architecture and design patterns. Here's what I've built:
Key Features Implemented:
Landing Page:

Clean choice interface with two compelling cards using your existing design system
Reused your color palette (blue for professional, red/pink for disruptor)
Maintained your typography hierarchy and spacing patterns
Used your proven card hover effects and animations

Professional Journey (Blue Theme):

Patient-focused messaging: "I believe that breakthrough medical technologies should reach every patient who needs them"
Clean, traditional approach emphasizing clinical success rates and proven methodology
Reused your hero section layout, badge styling, and stats grid
Focuses on the 95.5% success rate, $250M+ portfolio, and global expansion

Disruptor Journey (Dark Theme):

Organizational change focus: "Medical device companies lose their innovation edge one bureaucratic layer at a time"
Dark gradient background with vibrant pink accents
Emphasizes speed (5 days vs 90-day cycles), silo-breaking, and competitive advantage
Uses edgier language around "cutting through complexity" and "bureaucracy killing"

Design System Reuse:

Maintained your exact header structure and navigation styling
Reused your button designs, typography scales, and spacing patterns
Kept your hero section layout with badges, titles, subtitles, and stats grids
Used your responsive breakpoints and mobile adaptations

Interactive Elements:

Smooth transitions between modes with your existing animation patterns
Fixed back button for easy navigation between journeys
Maintains your scroll behavior and link interactions
Cards use your proven hover effects with transform and shadow changes

The website allows visitors to self-select into the narrative that resonates with their challenges while maintaining consistency with your established design language and user experience patterns. Each version presents the same achievements through different lenses - clinical excellence vs organizational transformation.
